 # Digital Network Empowerment:
    This repository contains projects completed during the Digital Network Empowerment internship program.

 # First Project:
# Weather Forecasting App

A C++ application that uses `libcurl` and `jsoncpp` to fetch and display hourly weather forecasts from the Open-Meteo API based on user-provided coordinates.

## Dependencies
               `libcurl`
               `jsoncpp`
 # Second Project:
# Contact Management System
 
A contact manager system is created using C++ that facilitates contact management for users. Contacts can be added, viewed and deleted through a simple menu-based approach. There is also, by default, a contact included in the application on its initialization.

Features

View Contacts: This feature lists all the contacts in the database along with their phone numbers.

Add Contacts: A feature that lets the user add more contacts to the database.

Delete Contacts: A feature that enables the user to erase a name from the contact list.

Default Contact: "Abdullah Azhar" fills in as the default first contact.

Clear Screen: It eliminates unnecessary data from the screen so as to enhance vision.

Exit Option: It is possible for users to exit the program with minimum difficulty.
## Dependencies
        No external libraries required.
