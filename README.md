 # Digital Network Empowerment:
    This repository contains projects completed during the Digital Network Empowerment internship program.

 # First Project:
# Weather Forecasting App

A C++ application that uses `libcurl` and `jsoncpp` to fetch and display hourly weather forecasts from the Open-Meteo API based on user-provided coordinates.

## Dependencies
               `libcurl`
               `jsoncpp`
 # Second Project:
# Contact Management System
 
A contact manager system is created using C++ that facilitates contact management for users. Contacts can be added, viewed and deleted through a simple menu-based approach. There is also, by default, a contact included in the application on its initialization.

Features

View Contacts: This feature lists all the contacts in the database along with their phone numbers.

Add Contacts: A feature that lets the user add more contacts to the database.

Delete Contacts: A feature that enables the user to erase a name from the contact list.

Default Contact: "Abdullah Azhar" fills in as the default first contact.

Clear Screen: It eliminates unnecessary data from the screen so as to enhance vision.

Exit Option: It is possible for users to exit the program with minimum difficulty.
## Dependencies
        No external libraries required.

 # Fifth Project: Mystical Forest Adventure Game
   ## Overview:
               A text-based interactive adventure game written in C++. Players navigate through a mystical forest, make decisions, encounter characters like dragons, and explore different paths based on their choices. The game uses simple conditional logic, loops, and user input to guide the player through branching narratives.

  ## Features:
              Branching Storyline: Players can choose different paths, such as venturing through a forest or encountering a dragon.
              Character Interaction: Options to fight or negotiate with a dragon, leading to different outcomes.
              Treasure Hunt: Explore a treasure cave if you successfully befriend the dragon.
              Replayability: Different choices lead to new experiences each time.
              User Input Validation: Ensures valid player choices and responses.
 ## Technologies:
 ### Language: C++
 ### Concepts: 
              Conditional statements, loops, user input handling
